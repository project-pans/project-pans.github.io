Uncertainty over what to buy at the grocery store is a common frustration, felt by many on a weekly basis. Unless meticulously planned beforehand, it is often very difficult for shoppers to know what items to buy, since they only have their own memories to go on. This leads to buying unneeded things and forgetting to buy the items that are needed. The Pantry App Notification System gives a solution to this problem by allowing shoppers to open an app and immediately know what items are in their pantries. This system will use a barcode scanner and weight sensors to keep track of what is in the pantry, then display that information on an app, which will be viewable to the user. This will allow a grocery shopper who is unsure of what to buy to simply pull out a mobile device and know exactly what items are needed.


PANS will utilize an elevated platform, which contains four plates for our weight sensors and the microcontroller. We will utilize 3D printed brackets to fasten our weight sensors to the platform. Prototypes for the platform and brackets can be seen below.
